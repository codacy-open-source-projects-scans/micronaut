https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] is an advanced JDK with ahead-of-time Native Image compilation, to generate native executables of Micronaut applications.

Any Micronaut application can be run on the GraalVM JDK, however special support has been added to Micronaut to support running Micronaut applications using https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM's `native-image` tool].

Micronaut framework currently supports GraalVM version {graalVersion} and the team is improving the support in every new release. Don't hesitate to https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues[report issues] however if you find any problem.

Many of Micronaut's modules and third-party libraries have been verified to work with GraalVM: HTTP server, HTTP client, Function support, Micronaut Data JDBC and JPA, Service Discovery, RabbitMQ, Views, Security, Zipkin, etc. Support for other modules is evolving and will improve over time.

=== Getting Started

NOTE: Only Java and Kotlin projects support using GraalVMâ€™s `native-image` tool. Groovy relies heavily on reflection, which is only partially supported by GraalVM.

To start using GraalVM, install this JDK. The easiest way to install GraalVM on Linux or Mac is to use https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!]. For other installation options, visit the https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[Downloads page].
